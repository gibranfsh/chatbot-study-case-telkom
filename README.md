- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

## How to Contribute

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch corresponding to the feature you want to work on or the bug you want to fix.
4. Commit and push your changes to that branch (make sure not to make changes directly to the `main` branch).
5. Create a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.
6. Wait for the reviewer to review and merge your pull request.
7. If the reviewer requests changes, make the requested changes, commit, and push them to the same branch, then notify the reviewer that the changes have been made.
8. Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch, and the branch you created will be deleted (to avoid unused branches).

Feel free to contribute to this project by fixing existing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰!

## Note

For this project, I am prioritizing the role of Backend Engineer. However, I am also very interested in and excited about Fullstack Engineering. If possible, I would love to work on both frontend and backend tasks to leverage my skills across the entire stack.
